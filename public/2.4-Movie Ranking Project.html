<h1>The Best movies according to Shajara</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time are...</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Captain America: Civil War</h3>
<p> This is has all the cool characters fighting each other...very cool.<br />
    I think I've watched it about 3 times.</p>

<h3>Parasite (2019)</h3>
<p> This was the first thriller I'd ever seen and I really like it. I watched it about two times and enjoyed each viewing. It revealed to me that I enjoy thriller movies that are not scary. <br />
    I do not like horror.</p>

<h3>Mario</h3>
<p> I've actually not seen this movie, but it seems nice loooool.</p>
